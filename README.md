✅ Summary of the Bank Employee CRUD Program

This program is a simple web-based Bank Management System focused on handling Employee Records using basic HTML and JavaScript.

📌 Core Features:

Add Employee: A form to enter employee details like name, email, phone, address, and salary.

View Employee List: Displays all employee records in a table fetched from a backend API

      (http://localhost:3000/api/employees).

Edit/Delete Buttons: UI buttons to edit or delete employee entries (logic placeholders included).

Basic Validation: Uses required fields to ensure form completeness.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML + Vanilla JavaScript

Backend (Expected): REST API (e.g., Node.js/Express on localhost)

🚀 Purpose:

Demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a banking context

Useful as a beginner-level project for learning web development and RESTful APIs

✅ Key Fixes Made:

Fixed typos in your script (featch → fetch, responce → response, etc.)

Corrected form structure and input labels (for="=empEmail" → for="empEmail")

Added missing logic for the editEmployee and deleteEmployee buttons (currently placeholders)

Improved formatting for better readability and future extension
